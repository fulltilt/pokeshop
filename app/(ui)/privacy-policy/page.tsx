        third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or X
        logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile
        information abdut you from your social media provider. The profile
        information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider
        concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends
        list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to
        make public on such a social media platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are
        described in this Privacy Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you
        on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are
        not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your

        10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
      </h2>
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
        activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
        online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no
        uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
        has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
        signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser
        DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal
        standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to
        them at this time.

        Under certain US state data protection laws, you can designate an
        authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. We may deny a request
        from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been
        validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with applicable
        laws.
      </p>
      <h3 className="font-semibold">Request Verification</h3>
      <p>
        Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
        determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in
        our system. We will only use personal information provided in your
        request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.
        However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already
        maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information
        for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud
        prevention purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you submit the request through an authorized agent, we may need to
        collect additional information to verify your identity before processing
        your request and the agent will need to provide a written and signed
        permission from you to submit such request on your behalf.
      </p>
      <h3 className="font-semibold">Appeals</h3>

        response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons
